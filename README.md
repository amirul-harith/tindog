# TinDog
A website to showcased a dog-based parody of the TinderApp, made for my own portfolio showcase purposes. 

In creating this, I'm attempting to apply what I've learnt about HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap framework to design websites.

I created this as part of the curriculum of 'The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp' by Angela Yu on udemy.com
