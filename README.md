# TinDog
Access via: https://amirul-harith.github.io/tindog/TinDog-master/index.html

A website to showcase a dog-based parody of the Tinder app, made for my own portfolio purposes. 

In creating this, I'm attempting to apply what I've learnt about HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap framework for website design.

I created this as part of the curriculum of 'The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp' by Angela Yu on udemy.com 

I'm still figuring out web development and what the best practices are in terms of uploading project pages and accessing them on GitHub. To preserve the same file hierarchy I had while working on it on my own machine, I've uploaded the master folder directly into this repository. Any advice or guidance would be appreciated. 

Thanks for stopping by!
